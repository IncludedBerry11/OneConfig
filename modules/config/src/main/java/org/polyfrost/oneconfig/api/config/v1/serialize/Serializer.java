/**
 * A serializer is a class that is capable of turning a {@link Tree} into a specific type {@link T}, and vice versa.
 * <br>
 * Trees are the primary data structure in OneConfig, and are used to represent configuration data. They are a tree structure,
 * with each node being a key-value pair of either a string and a sub-tree, or a string and some data.
 * <br>
 * <b>Trees can contain arbitrary, potentially complex data types in them</b>. You need to be able to serialize and deserialize this data into a specific type.
 * The easiest way to do this is to use the builtin {@link ObjectSerializer} which provides
 * simple methods to convert objects into simple types, along with the facility to use defined {@link Adapter}s.
 * The following types are used by this, and so you need to be able to serialize and deserialize them:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>primitive type wrappers (Number, Character, Boolean)</li>
 *     <li>CharSequence</li>
 *     <li>Lists or Arrays of the above types (at your discretion)</li>
 *     <li>Map (containing the above types).</li>
 * </ul>
 * If you don't want to use this facility, you can create your own complex object serializer and use that instead.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of data that your serializer outputs and accepts as input.
